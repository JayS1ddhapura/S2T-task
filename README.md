# S2T-task

This project takes a phone number as input and feeds the number to a lookup service provided by Twilio named "Twilio Lookup" to fetch information about the phone number from the web. After that, the same input is feeded to an android virtual machine to fetch a Whataspp profile by searching in Whatsapp with the phone number. 

## Getting Started

* Clone the repository in your local system. 

### Prerequisites

* Nodejs installed version > 14.0

* A virtual machine created on Android Studio

### Installing
* open terminal and go to the project directory. 
* run the command "npm install"
* run the command "npm run dev" 

### Creating Docker Image
* open terminal and go to the project directory.

## Endpoints

* /userInfo[POST] > Fetches information from twilio using Twilio Lookup API
* /search[POST] > Searches for phone number in Whatsapp in a virtual machine
* /userCard[GET] > Fetches user card from the database 

## Sample Payload for the given endpoints
```json
    {
    "contact" : "+14372999897"
    }
```

* The routes are accessible from index.js which will lead to the file UserRoutes.js where the routes are defined.
* UserRoutes will execute the functions defined in UserController. 
* UserCrontrolle will process on the provided data, store it in the database in will provide a response.
