# S2T-task

This project takes a phone number as input and feeds the number to a lookup service provided by Twilio named "Twilio Lookup" to fetch information about the phone number from the web. After that, the same input is feeded to an android virtual machine to fetch a Whataspp profile by searching in Whatsapp with the phone number. 

## Getting Started

## Description of Life cycle process

* The project starts from the index.js file in which first it creates and hosts a server as well as establishes a connection with the database. 
* The routes are accessible from index.js which will lead to the file UserRoutes.js where the routes are defined.
